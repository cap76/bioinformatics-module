# About the course 

The term “Machine Learning” encompasses a broad range of approaches in data analysis with wide applicability across biological sciences. Lectures will introduce commonly used approaches, provide insight into their theoretical underpinnings and illustrate their applicability and limitations through examples and exercises. During the practical sessions students will apply the algorithms to real biological data-sets using the R language and RStudio environment. All code utilised during the course will be available to participants.

## Prerequisites

* Some familiarity with R would be helpful.

## Github
The github reposotory for Classical approaches to Machine Learning containing code, datasets and lectures is availabile [here](https://github.com/cap76/bioinformatics-module). The html textbook is found in docs/index.html. Individual chapters (files ending .Rmd) can be opened in RStudio as interactive markdown files.
